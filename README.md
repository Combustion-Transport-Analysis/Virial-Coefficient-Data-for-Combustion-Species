# Virial-Coefficient-Data-for-Combustion-Species

Database for measurements of the second coefficient of the virial equation of state for several species of combustion interest. Most data have been obtained from the compilations by Dymond and Smith (1980) and Dymond et al. (2002), and span the last century.
