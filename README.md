# Virial-Coefficient-Data-for-Combustion-Species

Database for measurements and uncertainties of the second coefficient of the virial equation of state for several species of combustion interest. Most data have been obtained from the compilations by Dymond and Smith [1] and Dymond et al. [2], and span the last century. The present aim of this database is to determine the corresponding variation in molecular transport parameters, along with the effect of the resulting variation on combustion simulations [3].
